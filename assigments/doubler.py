# Complete the Code Challenge question. Good luck!

# Given two integer values, 
# return their sum. 
# If the two values are the same, 
# then return double their sum.

# For example:

# print(sum_double(1, 2))
# 3
# print(sum_double(5, 7))
# 12
# print(sum_double(5, 5))
# 20

def sum_double(x, y):

print(sum_double(1, 2))
print(sum_double(5, 7))
print(sum_double(5, 5))
