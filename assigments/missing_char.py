# Assignment - 4 (Missing Char)
# Complete the Code Challenge question. Good luck!

# 💡 Objective :
# To improve your defining function skills and string indexing ability.

# Given a non-empty string and an int n, return a new string
# where the character at index n has been removed. 
# The value of n will be a valid index of a character 
# in the original string (i.e. n will be in the range 0....len(str)-1 inclusive).
# For example:

# Test	Result
# print(missing_char('kitchen', 1))
# ktchen
# print(missing_char('kitchen', 0))
# itchen
# print(missing_char('kitchen', 4))
# kitcen
